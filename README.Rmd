## Package description

The **kuenm2** R package implements multiple tools to help with the development of detailed ecological niche models using distinct algorithms. Pre-modeling analyses and explorations can be done to prepare data. Model calibration (model selection) can be done by creating and testing several candidate models. Handy options for producing final models with transfers, and evaluating such models are included. Other tools to assess extrapolation risks and variability in model transfers are also available.

```{r fig1, fig.height=4, fig.width=6, fig.cap="Figure 1. Schematic view of the workflow to use kuenm2. Details on the workflow below.", echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/simple_wf.png")
```

## Installing the package

Note: Internet connection is required to install the package.

To install the latest release of **kuenm2** use the following line of code:

```{r installation, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# Installing from CRAN 
install.packages("kuenm2")
```

<br>

The development version of **kuenm2** can be installed using the code below. 

```{r installation1, eval=FALSE}
# Installing and loading packages
if(!require(remotes)){
  install.packages("remotes")
}

# To install the package use
remotes::install_github("marlonecobos/kuenm2")

# To install the package and its vignettes use (if needed use: force = TRUE)  
#remotes::install_github("marlonecobos/kuenm2", build_vignettes = TRUE)  # in the process
```

<br>

*Having problems?* 

If you have any problems during installation of the development version from GitHub, restart R session, close other RStudio sessions you may have open, and try again. If during the installation you are asked to update packages, do so if you don't need a specific version of one or more of the packages to be installed. If any of the packages give an error when updating, please install it alone using `install.packages()`, then try installing **kuenm2** again.

<br>

To load the package use:

```{r loading, eval=FALSE}
# Load kuenm2
library(kuenm2)
```

## Workflow description

### Data preparation

As shown in Fig. 1, to use **kuenm2** ...


<br>

### Model calibration

After preparing data, 


<br>

### Model projections

After the selection of best parameter settings and the fitting of such best performing models, projections to multiple scenarios can be done. To facilitate projections to simple or complex combinations of scenarios, use the **kuenm2** function `prepare_projection()`. 

<br>

## Variability and uncertainty

Variability in results can be summarized and represented using multiple options in **kuenm2**.


To represent uncertainty, the Mobility Oriented-Parity (MOP) metric is implemented in **kuenm2**.
